    <h4>An Ideal Husband</h4>
    <h6> ACT IV : Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House</h6>
    <p>[LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
        pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  [_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.]  It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
        talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
        latest edition of something or other.
        <br>
        [_Enter servant_.]
        <br>
        JAMES.  Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern not down yet?
        <br>
        JAMES.  Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
        come in from riding.
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  [_To himself_.]  Ah! that is something.
        <br>
        JAMES.  Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
        Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?
        <br>
        JAMES.  [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.
        <br>
        [_Exit servant_.]
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
        It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
        he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
        only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
        darlings.  [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
        begins to read it_.]
        <br>
        [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]
        <br>
        LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
        as usual, I suppose?
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one
        pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
        one’s own.
        <br>
        LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
        last night?
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  I have been thinking about nothing else.
        <br>
        LORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
        <br>
        LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till dinner-time if it
        would be of any convenience to you.
        <br>
        LORD GORING.  Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
        lunch.</P>

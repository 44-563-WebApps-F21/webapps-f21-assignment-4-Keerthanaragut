    <h4>An Ideal Husband</h4>
    <h6> ACT IV : Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House</h6>
    <p>[LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
        pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]</p>
       <h6> LORD GORING.</h6>  <P>[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.] </P> <p>It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
        talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
        latest edition of something or other.</p>
        <p>[_Enter servant_.]</p>
       <h6> JAMES. </h6> <p>Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>
        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p>Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
        come in from riding.</p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_To himself_.]</p> <p>Ah! that is something.</p> 
        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p> Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
        Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.</p>
       <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p> Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>
        <h6>JAMES.</h6> <p> [_Bowing_.]</p>  <p>I shall do so, my lord.</p>
        <p>[_Exit servant_.]</p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6> <p> Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
        It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
        he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
        only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
        darlings.</p>  <p>[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
        begins to read it_.]</p>
        <p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>
        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
        as usual, I suppose?</p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p> <p>My dear father, when one
        pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
        one’s own.</p>
        <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
        last night?</p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>
       <h6> LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p>Engaged to be married yet?</p>
        <h6>LORD GORING.</h6>  <p>[_Genially_.] </p> <p>Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>
    <h6>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p> [_Caustically_.]</p>  <p>You can have till dinner-time if it
        would be of any convenience to you.</p>
    <h6> LORD GORING.</h6> <p> Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
        lunch.</P>

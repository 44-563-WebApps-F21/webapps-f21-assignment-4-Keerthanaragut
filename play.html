    <h6> ACT IV : Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House</h6>
    <p class = "stage-direction"> 
         [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
        pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]
    </p>
       <h6 class ="name LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h6>  <P class = "stage-direction">[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.] </P> <p class = "speech">It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
        talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
        latest edition of something or other.</p>
        <p class = "stage-direction">[_Enter servant_.]</p>
       <h6 class ="name JAMES"> JAMES. </h6> <p class = "speech">Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class = "speech">Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>
        <h6 class ="name JAMES">JAMES.</h6> <p class = "speech">Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
        come in from riding.</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class = "stage-direction">[_To himself_.]</p> <p class = "speech">Ah! that is something.</p> 
        <h6 class ="name JAMES">JAMES.</h6> <p class = "speech"> Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
        Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.</p>
       <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class = "speech"> Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>
        <h6 class ="name JAMES">JAMES.</h6> <p class = "stage-direction"> [_Bowing_.]</p>  <p class = "speech">I shall do so, my lord.</p>
        <p class = "stage-direction">[_Exit servant_.]</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6> <p class = "speech"> Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
        It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
        he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
        only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
        darlings.</p>  <p class = "stage-direction">[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
        begins to read it_.]</p>
        <p class = "stage-direction ">[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p class = "speech">Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
        as usual, I suppose?</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class = "stage-direction">[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p> <p class = "speech">My dear father, when one
        pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
        one’s own.</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p class = "speech">Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
        last night?</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class = "speech">I have been thinking about nothing else.</p>
       <h6 class ="name LORDCAVERSHAM"> LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6>  <p class = "speech">Engaged to be married yet?</p>
        <h6 class ="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class = "stage-direction">[_Genially_.] </p> <p class = "speech">Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>
    <h6 class ="name LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p class = "stage-direction"> [_Caustically_.]</p>  <p class = "speech">You can have till dinner-time if it
        would be of any convenience to you.</p>
    <h6 class ="name LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h6> <p class = "speech"> Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
        lunch.</P>
